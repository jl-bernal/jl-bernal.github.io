I'm Jose, and work as a theoretical physicist interested in cosmology and astrophysics. I have a Ramón y Cajal Fellow position (tenure-track-like position) at the [Institute of Physics of Cantabria](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us) (IFCA) in the and the University of Cantabria (UC) in Santander, Spain. Before moving back to Spain, I earned my PhD title at the Institute of Cosmos Sciences in the University of Barcelona (ICC-UB), Spain, under the supervision of Prof. Licia Verde, worked as a Davis Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, US, working primarily with the group of Prof. Marc Kamionkowski, and spent few months as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, working within the physical cosmology group led by Prof. Eiichiro Komatsu.

Mainly, I work on the interface between theoretical and observational cosmology, with special interest in dark matter and the phenomenology of models beyond &Lambda;CDM in cosmological observables. During the last years, my interests have been increasingly overlaping with extragalactic astrophysics, working on probes like line-intensity mapping that are sensitive both to cosmology and astrophysics. I also have dedicated much work and thought to tensions between cosmological observations and agnostic approaches to analyze their measurements.

The cosmology group at IFCA is always looking for talented postdocs, PhD candidates and Masters students. If you are interested, please contact me! There are regular openings and plenty of opportunities for these positions.
