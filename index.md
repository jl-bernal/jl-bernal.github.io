I am a Davis Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, US, working primarily with Prof. Marc Kamionkowski. Just before moving to Johns Hopkins, I earned my PhD title at the Institute of Cosmos Science in the University of Barcelona (ICC-UB), under supervision of Prof. Licia Verde.  

Mainly, I work on the interface between theoretical and observational cosmology, with special interest in dark matter and the phenomenology of models beyond &Lambda;CDM in cosmological observables. During the last years, my interests have been increasingly overlaping with extragalactic astrophysics, working on probes like line-intensity mapping that are sensitive both to cosmology and astrophysics. I also have dedicated much work and thought to tensions between cosmological observations and agnostic approaches to analyze their measurements.
