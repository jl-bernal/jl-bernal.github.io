I am always happy to contribute to and get involved in outreach activities. Feel free to contact me if you are organizing any outreach activity and are interested in my participation. 

Below you can find a list of my outreach activities:

- [**The Universe: a window to fundamental physics**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tXb-7klCfUR7luOU-LtG_hMNew_QPZbCjxXe80pG4tQ/present?usp=sharing) Public outreach talk at the Pedro Pascual Science Center of Benasque, covering cosmology and the tension between the direct measurements of the Hubble constant assuming the standard cosmological model. (slides in Spanish)

- [**At what speed does the Universe expand?**]({{ site.url }}/assets/docs/JLB_AAS_red.pdf) Talk for amateur astronomers discussing the tension between the direct measurements of the Hubble constant in the local Universe and the values inferred from early-Universe measurements assuming the standard cosmological model. (slides in Spanish)

- [**Unravelling the Dark Universe**](https://serviparticules.ub.edu/en/materials/exhibitions/unravelling-dark-universe): Poster exhibition about cosmology, gravity and black holes. Available in English, Spanish, Catalan (printed version available to exhibit), Italian and Portuguese. 

- [**Walk on the Dark Side**]({{ site.url }}/assets/docs/WalkDarkSide.pdf): Talk for physics bachelor students discussing the basics of Physical cosmology, especially regarding the main cosmological probes that have helped established the standard cosmological model. (slides in Spanish)

- **Round table about dark matter**: Round table hosted at the University of Bareclona to discuss about dark matter during the "Dark Matter Day" with physics bachelor students.

- **Physics experiments**: Short demonstrations for highschool students.
