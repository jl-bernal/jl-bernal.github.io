Teaching is a fundamental part of this job and I do enjoy teaching and mentoring junior researchers. 

- Currently, I teach Cosmology in the [Master in Particle Physics and Cosmology](https://masterphyparcos.ifca.es/), offered by the University of Cantabria and the International University Menendez Pelayo. 
   You can find the [(live) notes of the course here]({{ site.url }}/assets/docs/Cosmo_Lectures.pdf)
   
 - I have also participated in PhD schools as a lecturer, such as the [Theoretical Aspects of Astroparticle Physics, Cosmology and Gravitation](https://www.ggi.infn.it/showevent.pl?id=445) at the Galileo Galilei Institute in Florence, in 2023. I taught an around 10 hours course in Cosmic Tensions. You can find the [notes corresponding to the course here](https://agenda.infn.it/event/33079/sessions/25414/attachments/103532/144965/GGI_tensions_lectures-and-tutorials-2023.pdf). If you explore the [Indico website of the school](https://agenda.infn.it/event/33079/), you will also find very interesting notes on other topics in Physics, Cosmology and Gravitation, as well as the information and resources about previous schools.
 
 - While I was working on my PhD in Barcelona, I spend some time as teaching assistant in courses of Differential Equations and Vectorial Calculus and Astronomy in the Physics Bachelor in the University of Barcelona.
